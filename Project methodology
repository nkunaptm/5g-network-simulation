# Methodology for simulation

The implementation of the network simulation was done in python. In this network
simulation there is a network class that will create the network and will manage the
MVNOs, the MVNO class will manage and create slices within the network. The slice
class will house the parameters of each slice that is created, A group class creates
the group of subscribers that are connected to the created slices. A driver class is
used to control the simulation as well as log results for each simulation. Figure 1 is a
visual representation of what has just been described, The code used for the
simulations can be found in the Appendix
As simulation begins a network is created, specifications for this are shown in the
page to follow. Inside this network there are several MVNOs created, these MVNOs
contained slices. To each of these slices a minimum of two groups of subscribers
were connected. The number of admissible states for each slice is determined, from
theses state the number of blocking/dropping states for new/handoff calls is
determined. If multiple groups were connected to each slice then the
blocking/dropping states were determined for each group, if only one group is
connected then only that groups blocking/dropping states are determined.
The equations to follow were used to determine the admissible states and
blocking/dropping states:
The current state of the system is represented:  = (𝑚𝐴, 𝑛𝐴, 𝑚𝐵, 𝑚𝐵)
With 𝑚𝑖 and 𝑛𝑖 are the number of ongoing new calls and ongoing handoff calls in
group 𝑖 respectively.
With the Sample Space 𝑆 = { = (𝑚𝐴, 𝑛𝐴, 𝑚𝐵, 𝑚𝐵
): (𝑚𝐴 + 𝑛𝐴
) ∗ 𝑏 ≤ 𝐶𝐴 ∧
(𝑚𝐵 + 𝑛𝐵
) ∗ 𝑏 ≤ 𝐶𝐵
For the Group A the subscribers have new blocking states s  S, for which:
(((1 + 𝑚𝐴 + 𝑛𝐴
) ∗ 𝑏 > 𝑇𝐴) 𝑜𝑟 ((1 + 𝑚𝐵 + 𝑛𝐵
) ∗ 𝑏 > 𝑇𝐵))
For the Group A the subscribers have handoff call dropping states s  S, for which:
(((1 + 𝑚𝐴 + 𝑛𝐴
) ∗ 𝑏 > 𝐶𝐴) 𝑜𝑟 ((1 + 𝑚𝐵 + 𝑛𝐵
) ∗ 𝑏 > 𝐶𝐵))
For the Group B the subscribers have new blocking states s  S, for which:
((1 + 𝑚𝐵 + 𝑛𝐵
) ∗ 𝑏 > 𝑇𝐵)
For the Group B the subscribers have handoff call dropping states s  S, for which:
((1 + 𝑚𝐵 + 𝑛𝐵
) ∗ 𝑏 > 𝐶𝐵)
With 𝑇𝑖 and 𝐶𝑖 being the threshold and capacity of group 𝑖 respectively
